# Introduction to the mbed Porting Guide

The mbed Porting Guide walks you through porting mbed products to Cortex-M based hardware:

* mbed OS:
  * [General porting process](): The full process of porting mbed OS.
  * [Porting HAL components](): Detailed porting instructions for individual components of the hardware abstraction layer.
  * [Porting Targets](): Porting targets to mbed OS using target inheritance.
* [mbed OS uVisor](): Porting instructions for the mbed OS uVisor component.
* Additional components:
  * [mbed Client](): Can work independently of mbed OS, and can therefore be ported on its own.
  * [The 6LoWPAN stack](): Device Driver API for different physical layer drivers.
